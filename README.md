## Hi there 👋
I'm a 24 yo 🌱 software developer 💻

I’m currently learning 📖 all kind of things that have a GPU word inside ! More seriously I ❤️ and I am facinated by computer graphics. On my github you can found lot of things that have a relation with computer graphics.

Actualy I learn (in my free time) a beautiful language named [Rust ❤️](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and make some computer graphics things with it and some crates (Rust libs).
