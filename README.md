<h2 align="center">Hi 👋</h2>

I'm a 24 yo 🌱 graphics software developer 💻

I’m currently working at [Jusdeliens](https://jusdeliens.com/) where I code a lot of things for education 🏫 & robots 🤖.

I ❤️ games and I am facinated by computer graphics. I also love all kind of procedural algorithm *(like [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) or [Marching Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes)* and code optimizations. On this github you can found lot of things that have a relation with.

Actualy I worked on a home made graphic engine named [GraphX](https://github.com/5aitama/GraphX) that was built on top of [WebGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).
