## Hi there 👋
I'm a 24 yo 🌱 software developer 💻

I’m currently learning 📖 all kind of things that have a GPU word inside ! More seriously I ❤️ games and I am facinated by computer graphics. I also love all kind of procedural algorithm like [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) or [Marching Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) that I have implemented and code optimizations. On my github you can found lot of things that have a relation with.

Actualy I learn (in my free time) a beautiful language named [Rust ❤️](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and make some computer graphics things with it and some crates (Rust libs).

## Favorite languages
1. [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) - Love it!
2. [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)/) - Good but GC sucks!
3. [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) - Very good !
4. [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - Same as C++ without [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
